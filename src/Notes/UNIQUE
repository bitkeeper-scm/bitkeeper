In order to ensure that delta keys are unique, we're going to try the following:

Create in $BK_BIN/tmp/keys.mdbm an mdbm where db{ROOTKEY} = timestamp
of TOT if the timestamp is less than CLOCK_DRIFT seconds ago, again only
for those keys created on this host.

The database is updated whenever we create a delta, and whenever we resolve
incoming work.

Note that the list is not going to grow without bound - we are only
interested in keys which were created on this host, and for timestamp
values in the last CLOCK_DRIFT seconds.  We'll start out with a
CLOCK_DRIFT of 48 hours and see if we need to shrink it.  The 48 hours
is because sometimes people screw up their daylight savings time plus
a generous amount of slop.

LOCKING
-------

The rules for locking are:

    1) the lock file is $BK_BIN/tmp/keys.lock
    2) the lock file contains the pid (in ascii) of the process locking the db
    3) if the pid is gone, the lock is broken

GOTCHAS
-------

Have citool be sure it can find BK_BIN before taking in any comments on 
BK files.
