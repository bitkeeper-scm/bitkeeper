Upgrade notes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nothing is required to upgrade from the 3.0.1 release.

New Features
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Support SCO and Tru64 platforms

  Tcl/Tk is now included is distribution, eliminating dependancies on the
  installed version.

  Windows support now uses Cygwin 1.3.22

  Consistency checks now display a progress bar unless -q is passed or BK_NOTTY
  is set.

Noteworthy Bug Fixes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  2002-11-07-001 revtool fails when run on a certain repostiory
  2002-12-09-004 some colors are missing from X configs
  2002-12-18-001 sfiles -i in corrupted tree dumps core
  2002-12-28-002 have rclone respect checkout preference
  2003-01-16-001 fix line length limitation with compressed files
  2003-01-17-003 import -tRCS -jN fails if N is too large
  2003-01-24-001 allow tags to contains spaces
  2003-02-03-002 add remote level to push error messages
  2003-02-19-001 takepatch could fail if patches contain really long lines
  2003-05-20-002 Evaluation license quota error message "off-by-one"

  Fix permissions problems in resolve.  In some cases where a user
  only has partial write permissions to a repository, resolve could
  fail after partially applying an incoming patch.  This left the tree
  in an unusable state.  These problems are now detected.

  'bk changes -L' could rarely report csets that do exist in the
  remote tree when there are local tags.  This is now fixed.

  win32: Handle windows style pathnames in 'bk mv'

  Fix race condition that can result in the lost of the ChangeSet file
  when multiple people access the same repository.

  Fix some cases where the 3-way merge could generate really strange
  results.  Significantly improved merging in some conditions.

  Make 'bk fix -c' work better in checkout:edit mode.

  Fix some obscure csetprune bugs...

  Fix problem with 'bk multiuser' when upgrading single_user repository.

  Fix a problem where 'bk changes' and 'bk sccslog' could assert
  because of a fixed sized buffer for expanding dspec keywords.
  BUGIDs: 2003-04-04-001 2002-02-28-002 2002-09-13-001
  
  Do a better job of handling file comments with really long lines.  Also
  add a 'bk delta -Yfile' option like 'bk commit -Yfile'.

Release notes for BitKeeper version 3.0.1.   These release notes cover
the following topics:

. Upgrade Notes
. New Features
. Noteworthy bug fixes

Upgrade notes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nothing is required to upgrade from the 3.0 release.

New Features
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Export a BK_COMMENTFILE variable so that the pre-commit triggers
    can check the comments for entries such as BUGIDs
    (see 'bk help trigger' for more information)

  - Several Performance enhancements
     - recode some sections of takepatch to dramatically speedup
       applying large numbers of deltas to 1 file
     - Fixes to make 'bk clone -l' faster
     - enable partial checks in 'bk clone -l' and 'bk undo'

  - Now each repository generates a unique identifier that can be used
    for tracking.  The id can be fetched with 'bk id -r' and it is
    passed to triggers in BK_REPO_ID and BKD_REPO_ID.  The ID of
    remote repositories are also recorded in the logs.
  
  - Added the ability for the following GUIs to save and restore their
    geometry information: renametool, fmtool, fm3tool, citool, bugform

  - win32: make installation of bkshellx.dll and bkscc.dll optional

  - Added :MD5KEY: dspec that can be used to get a shorter unique id
    for a delta or changeset.

  - Add 'bk obscure' command to scramble your tree.  That allows
    sending repositories to BitMover for debug without revealing
    secret IP.

  Security fixes:

    Put all tmp files in BitKeeper/tmp by default.  Allow user to
    change the tmp location with TMPDIR

    Never use /bin/sh to run subprocesses

Noteworthy Bug Fixes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  2002-09-13-002: 'bk parent' prints bogus error when there is no parent
  2002-10-10-002: If takepatch fails because a file is edited print the 
		  original file name not the name it will be after this 
		  patch.
  2002-10-11-001: Exiting resolve early will no longer clean some
		  files in the users tree.
  2002-10-11-002: A failed undo will no longer clean some files in the
		  users tree.
  2002-10-14-001: Importing huge repositories caused an assert
  2002-11-15-002: 'bk changes -uUSER -c-1w' didn't work.
  2002-11-19-002: revtool would sort revisions incorrectly (1.9 vs 1.10)
  2002-11-06-002: Go to a different uid/gid permanently in bkd.
  2002-11-23-001: 'dlm' in "bk resolve" now does the right thing
  2002-11-25-003: Prompts go to stderr instead of stdout.

  2002-11-26-001 2002-11-05-002 2002-09-30-005 2002-08-16-001
  2002-06-27-002: Fix various bugs with the handling of checkout:edit
		  in 'bk fix -c' 'bk cset -x' and 'bk unrm'

  Fix bug where changes in an edited config file didn't get used during
  a pull.

  Fix bug where DOS line termination was not always removed correctly
  when a file is originally created or imported.

  Fix bug that didn't allow people to enable single_user repositories
  and openlogging at the same time. Though it's not clear why a user
  would want to use these together.

  Fix rare condition where a tag conflict doesn't go away after it is
  resolved originally.

  Fix some problems running on a case-folding file system under UNIX.
  The default FS for Mac OS X is an example.

  Minor bug in SCCS keyword expansion.  '% %A%' didn't expand

  citool will now always report any errors or unexpect output from 
  'bk commit' to the user and give them a chance to recover.

  Fixed problem where the license information in the
  BitKeeper/etc/config file was not always used if the information was
  not committed.

  Fixed some bugs where the Windows version could get confused by 
  autoproxy support in IE.

  Fix problems on Windows when the native Tcl (included with
  BitKeeper) and the Cygwin Tcl are both installed on the users
  machine.  Bk now finds the correct version of Tcl.

  Fix problems running a bkd when it doesn't have write permission to
  a repository.

      fixes may be destructive (unlikely to be needed by anyone other than
      the MySQL maintainers)
