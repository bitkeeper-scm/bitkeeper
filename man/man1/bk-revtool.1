.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
revtool is one of the primary tools used when doing code reviews,
tracking down bugs, and when following the progress of a project.
.LP
revtool shows checkin comments and the graph history of a project
or file.  Revtool may be used to view any revision controlled file,
including the ChangeSet file. When no filename is given, the entire
package history is shown.
.LP
Revtool has an upper window which shows the graph of revision history
and a lower window which can show either the checkin comments or
differences between versions.

.SH "HISTORY AND DIFFERENCES"
.LP
Upon startup, the bottom window displays the last month's revision
history for the file or project.
.LP
To view the comments for just one revision, left click once on that
revision in the graph.
.LP
To see the differences between two revisions, left click the older
revision and right click on the newer revision.  The differences
will be displayed in the lower text window.  You can right click on
another revision and diff again.  The default diff format is
.B \-u
(unified diffs).
.LP
To see the contents of a file, double click the left mouse button
on the revision node in the graph.  The text shown for the file is
annotated with the user name and the latest revision that modified
the line. The file text is generated with the
.B bk get \-ump
command.
.LP
Once the annotated file listing is shown, you can then click on
the text to view the checkin comments associated with the chosen
line. Double clicking on an annotated line brings up csettool and
shows all of the other files that were modified in the same changeset
as the selected line.
.LP
To get a side\-by\-side view of the differences, select the two revisions
and click on the "Diff tool" button.
.SH CHANGESETS
.LP
When operating on the ChangeSet file, the behavior is slightly
different.  Double\-clicking a revision displays the revision history
of the changeset and the history of the changes to each file contained
in that changeset.
.LP
If you click left/right on a range of changesets, you will get the
history of the entire range of changesets.  To see the history and the
differences in detail, you can click on the "View changeset" button
to bring up the changeset browser tool, csettool.  Typical usage is
to browse the ChangeSet file with revtool and drill down using
.B bk
.BR csettool .
