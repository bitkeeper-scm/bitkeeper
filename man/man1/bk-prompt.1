This interface may be used for either command line or graphical environments.
If the environment variable \s-2\fBBK_GUI\fP\s0 is set, then the graphical
tool will be used instead of the command line version.  All of the \*[BK]
GUI tools set this variable automatically such that any call to bk prompt
from inside the graphical tools will result in a graphical prompt, including
the execution of any user supplied triggers.
.LP
If the environment
variable \s-2\fBBK_MSG_GEOM\fP\s0 is set, the graphical tool will use the
value of this variable to locate itself on the screen.  The format of the
variable must be in the for 
.I +x+y
where "x" and "y" are screen coordinates.  bk citool sets this variable 
automatically such that the prompt will be at the same x/y location as
the upper left corner of citool.
