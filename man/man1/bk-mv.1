.SH NAME 
bk mv \- rename file[s]
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bk mv [\-f]
.ARG "source file[s]"
.ARG "destination file or directory"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
To rename a file/directory from
.ARG A
to
.ARG B
do this:
.DS
$ bk mv A B
.DE
.ft R
The
.B mv
command will rename the checked out file (if any) as well as the
revision control file.  Edited files are also renamed and then reedited,
preserving any changes made but not yet checked in.
The rename
will appear as an additional change to the file when you commit the
next changeset.
.LP
Renames propagate just like content changes,
i.e., they happen automatically when you pull changes into your 
repository from another repository unless you have also renamed the file.
In that case, the resolver will prompt you to choose a name.
.LP
If the last argument is an existing directory,
.B bk mv
moves all listed files into that directory.
Otherwise, if only two files are given, it renames the first as the
second.  It is an error if more than two files are listed and the last
argument is not a directory.  In summary,
.B bk mv
behaves like a 
a regular Unix 
.B mv
command, execpt that it knows about the additional
BitKeeper files.
.SH NOTES
.LP
.B bk mv
will refuse to move BitKeeper metafiles without the 
.B \-f
option (use of which is not recommended).
